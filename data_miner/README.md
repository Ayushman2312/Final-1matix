   - Added natural scrolling patterns
   - Implemented random mouse movements
   - Added pauses between actions to appear more human-like

6. **CAPTCHA Detection**
   - Enhanced both request-based and browser-based CAPTCHA detection
   - Added comprehensive checks for CAPTCHA indicators
   - Improved handling of detected CAPTCHAs with automatic recovery

7. **Main Search Function**
   - Updated `search_google()` to better handle both browser and HTTP-based approaches
   - Added improved fallback mechanisms when one approach fails

8. **Scrape Function**

   - Improved post-processing of search results for better relevance
   - Added better error handling and reporting

## Background Tasks Support

The Data Miner now supports running tasks in the background, allowing you to:

1. Start multiple data mining tasks that continue to run when you navigate away from the page
2. Monitor all your running tasks in a dedicated dashboard
3. Stop tasks that may be taking too long or are no longer needed
4. View detailed information about task progress, parameters, and results

### Running a Task in Background

On the main Data Miner page:

1. Enter your search keyword, select the data type and country
2. Make sure the "Run in background" checkbox is checked (enabled by default)
3. Click "Get" to start the task
4. The task will be added to your background tasks list

### Managing Background Tasks

Access the task management page by:
- Clicking "View All Tasks" on the main Data Miner page, or
- Going directly to `/data_miner/background-tasks/`

The task management page provides:

- A list of running tasks with real-time progress updates
- A list of completed tasks with their results
- Options to stop running tasks
- Options to delete task records
- Quick access to download results from completed tasks

### Task Lifecycle

Each background task goes through the following stages:

1. **Pending**: The task has been created but hasn't started execution yet
2. **Processing**: The task is actively running and collecting data
3. **Completed**: The task has successfully finished and results are available
4. **Failed**: The task encountered an error during execution
5. **Cancelled**: The task was manually stopped by the user

### Stopping a Task

To stop a running task:

1. Find the task in the running tasks section
2. Click the "Stop" button
3. Confirm the cancellation
4. The task will be moved to the completed tasks section with "Cancelled" status

## How to Use

The contact scraper can be used as follows:

```python
from web_scrapper import ContactScraper

# Initialize the scraper
scraper = ContactScraper(debug_mode=True)

# Extract contacts from a search keyword
emails, phones = scraper.scrape("hotels in mumbai", num_results=50, max_runtime_minutes=15)

# Print results
print(f"Found {len(emails)} emails and {len(phones)} phone numbers")
```

## Testing

A test script (`test_scraper.py`) has been created to verify the improvements. Run it with:

```
python test_scraper.py
```

This will test various components of the scraper to ensure they're working correctly.
