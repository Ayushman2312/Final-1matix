# Beesuggest - Product Management System

## Overview
Beesuggest is a comprehensive product management system integrated into the 1Matrix masteradmin interface. It allows masteradmin users to review, edit, and manage product submissions from users.

## Features

### 1. Product Listing Dashboard
- **URL**: `/masteradmin/beesuggest/`
- **View**: `BeesuggestView`
- **Template**: `templates/masteradmin/beesuggest.html`

**Functionality**:
- Display all product submissions with pagination (10 products per page)
- Search functionality across organization, keywords, description, username, and email
- Filter by status (Published/Pending Review)
- Quick actions for publish/unpublish/delete
- Statistics display (Total, Published, Pending products)
- Professional card-based layout with product images and details

### 2. Product Edit Interface
- **URL**: `/masteradmin/beesuggest/edit/<product_id>/`
- **View**: `EditProductView`
- **Template**: `templates/masteradmin/edit_product.html`

**Functionality**:
- Comprehensive edit form for all product fields
- Image upload and management (5 product images)
- Dynamic variation management
- Dynamic FAQ management
- Publish/Unpublish/Delete actions
- Real-time form validation
- Auto-save functionality

## Database Model
The system uses the `ProductDetails` model from the `beesuggest` app with the following key fields:

- **User Relationship**: `ForeignKey` to Django User model
- **Publishing Status**: `is_published`, `published_at` fields
- **Content Fields**: Keywords, descriptions, images, videos, contact info
- **Dynamic Fields**: JSON fields for variations and FAQs
- **Audit Fields**: `submitted_at`, `updated_at` timestamps

## API Integration
The system respects the existing API access control:
- **Published Products Only**: API endpoints filter by `is_published=True`
- **Security**: Only published products are accessible via public APIs
- **CORS Compliance**: Restricted to allowed domains

## Access Control
- **Authentication Required**: All Beesuggest pages require masteradmin authentication
- **Session-based**: Uses Django session authentication
- **Role-based**: Only masteradmin users can access the interface

## Navigation
Added to the masteradmin sidebar navigation:
- **Icon**: Store/product icon
- **Position**: Between Feedbacks and Users sections
- **Responsive**: Works on all device sizes

## File Structure
```
masteradmin/
├── views.py (BeesuggestView, EditProductView)
├── urls.py (beesuggest routes)
└── templates/masteradmin/
    ├── beesuggest.html (listing page)
    └── edit_product.html (edit interface)
```

## Usage Workflow

### For Masteradmin Users:
1. **Access**: Navigate to "Beesuggest" in the sidebar
2. **Review**: Browse submitted product listings
3. **Filter**: Use search and status filters to find specific products
4. **Edit**: Click "Edit & Manage" to modify product details
5. **Publish**: Use publish/unpublish actions to control API visibility
6. **Manage**: Delete products if necessary

### For Regular Users:
1. Submit products via the beesuggest product form
2. Wait for masteradmin review and approval
3. Published products become available via API endpoints
4. View their submissions in the user dashboard
