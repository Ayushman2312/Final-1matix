You need to create the following PWA icon files:

1. icon-192x192.png (192x192 pixels) - Main app icon for Android
2. icon-512x512.png (512x512 pixels) - Large app icon for Android
3. apple-icon-180x180.png (180x180 pixels) - Icon for iOS devices

Also create splash screen images in the splash directory:

1. splash-640x1136.png - For iPhone SE
2. splash-750x1334.png - For iPhone 6/7/8
3. splash-1242x2208.png - For iPhone 6+/7+/8+

These should be your 1Matrix logo on a solid background with proper dimensions.
You can use design tools like Photoshop, Figma, or online tools like Canva to create these icons.

For a professional look, ensure the icons have:
- Clear, high-resolution imagery
- Proper padding around the logo (generally 15% of the width)
- Consistent branding
- Appropriate color contrast

Once created, replace this placeholder file with the actual icon files.
